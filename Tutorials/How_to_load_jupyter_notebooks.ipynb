    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks are a great tool to keep track of the workflow for your data analysis. You can load up your results, maniplate them, make pretty figures, export your final data and figures to a file, all in one place!\n",

If anyone else is using this number, your notebook will not load. Add the & sign at the end of the line to allow this command to \"run in the background\". Without it, you will not be able to return to the command line while running a notebook in this window.\n",

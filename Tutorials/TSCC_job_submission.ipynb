    "When you login to TSCC you are automatically placed on the **Head node** or **login node**. The amount of resources dedicated to the login node are enough for basic commands like making files and moving things around, but are not enough to power computationally intensive jobs like aligning reads to a genome or quantifying gene expression. To do these things we will ask for more resources and submit that request as a job to the cluster. \n",

    "**Submission script**\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit a job, we will use PBS flags to tell the supercomputer how many resources we need and how to keep track of our job. All the details of this are [here](http://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/tscc-quick-start.html) but we will go over the most important points together. The first lines of your submission script contain all the parameters the computer needs to know how to run your job. \n",

    "-N: give your job a unique name so you can track it!\n",
    "\n",
    "-l: Request nodes, processers per node, and walltime. This will vary depending on the program you are running. You can request up to 16 processors per node. It is good practice to request as many processors on one node before requesting multiple nodes. The walltime is approximately how long you think your job will need to take to run. Overestimate this value, because if your job is not finished when the walltime ends it will kill it in the middle. But if your job finishes before the walltime ends, it will terminate and send you the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "-o: name of the job outputfile that you get from this run. I find it helpful to be the same name as the jobname with a .out extension. More on this later. \n",

Edit a new file called test_submission.sh (.sh is the suffix used for bash scripts) and put your submission parameters, and command inside it. Ask for 1 node, 1 processor per node, and 5 minutes of walltime (this is a tiny job). Give your job a meaningful name, output file, and error file. Make sure you know what directory you are in and where these things are going. I want to put the script in the job_submission_test folder, so I am first going to check that I am there with pwd (print working directory).\n",

This file will automatically go into the directory where you submitted the job and be called whatever you named it with the -o flag in your script. Sometimes when a command it running, it will automatically output things on your screen with updates on how the job is progressing. These will get saved in this file. This can be useful later on for debugging to find out how long your command progressed before dying. Take a look in the file. With this example, it will only print the nodes that were used for processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The job .err file. Same rules apply with the .out file, you should also find it in the directory where you submitted your job. This file contains any errors associated with your script. If you don't get the output of your command that you expected, this is a good place to go to read error messages that tell you what went wrong. Take a look inside the file from this job. Is there anything in it? If not, great! Your command ran successfully. \n",

You can use the ENCODE website, or other sources that you find. You can even use things that have been published and uploaded to the GEO repository, we will help you download any datasets that you find particularly interesting!\n",

The RNA-Seq must have at least two conditions and two replicates per condition (3 replicates is even better!) Explain why you chose the datasets you did and how they will be used to answer your question. What particular features of that type of assay make it the best choice in order to answer your particular question? Make sure that for your second dataset, you can download processed data (a list of peaks, or DNA variants that were called).\n",
